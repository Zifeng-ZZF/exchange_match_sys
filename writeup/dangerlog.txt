3.15 We start to wirte parse request and try to learn how to use packet in Java to implement.
3.16 Write test for parser and start to think about server logic.
3.20 We finish the create part of server. We test it and find there are several corner that we didn't think of before.
We add more error checker and modify our code.
3.25 We finish the implement of transaction part.
3.27 We test our transaction part and find we can't match correctly. When there are orders that can match, the server did 
nothing. We review our code and find there are some logistic error. We fix this part of problem.
3.29 We test more cases and find there are some request error that aren't handled. We add more error checking.
3.30 We begin to design scalability test and implement it. We test two cases. One is add more cores, the other is 
increase the number of requests. We test a bunch of grout data and draw a diagram to show it directly. And then finish our report.
